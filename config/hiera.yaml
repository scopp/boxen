# This file configures the hiera "database" for Boxen. As with most files in
# this repo, it's just an example, and you should feel free to make any
# changes suited to your organisation.

# The defaults here should give you a solid start; put global defaults in
# a file named hiera/common.yaml, and individuals can supplement and/or override
# them in hiera/{github_login}.yaml

#
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/configuring.html
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/puppet.html
#
# For example, on "jdigger"'s work MBP he has a "fact" defined
#   as {::boxen_project_01 => 'developer'}
# That means that the following files are merged:
# 
# people/jdigger/nodes/Jims-MacBook-Pro-2.yaml  # hostname
# people/jdigger/nodes/common.yaml
# people/jdigger.yaml
# projects/developer.yaml

# Many modules make their own hiera data available through the use of
# puppet-module-data. Some depend on the 'deeper' merge_behavior setting, so
# remove it at your own risk!
# ...
# besides the modules that use it, you might want to override deeply nested hash
# values, too!
